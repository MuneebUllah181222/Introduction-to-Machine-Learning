## Machine Learning Intro

> Welcome to the "Machine Learning Intro" repository! This repository is a part of my machine learning journey where I have implemented some basic machine learning models and concepts using the Python programming language and popular libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn.
This repository includes code for data exploration, decision tree machine learning model, model validation, underfitting and overfitting, and random forest algorithm. These concepts are essential to understand the basics of machine learning and are a great starting point for beginners.
Whether you are new to machine learning or an experienced practitioner, this repository is a great resource to learn the basics of machine learning and improve your skills. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different models and techniques, and provide feedback on any issues you encounter.
